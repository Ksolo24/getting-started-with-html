  <h1>Basics of the Web</h1>
  <b>The Web</b>
    <p>The www(World Wide Web) is a collection of HTML documents, with over 30 billion pages in total. HTML documents are made up of something called HTML(Hypertext Mark up Language), a language that web browsers can read  & compose them into visible or audible web pages. HTML documents are made up of tags and elements, browsers do not display the HTML tags and scripts, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

  <b>How a Web Page Works</b>
    <p>When a user wants to access a web page he runs a browser(for example, Google Chrome)  to display HTML documents found on the web, through the internet which connects it to the server.The internet is the world's largest computer network & a server is a computer that host the HTML files that make up the web page. The internet does this by following a set of rules called HTTP, a protocol of the web. </p>
